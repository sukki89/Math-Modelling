Problem 3: 

f) The first 3 eigen vectors are:
octave:31> u(:,1:3)
ans =

  -0.4939721  -0.1888034   0.3474625
  -0.5097648  -0.1138690   0.3256194
  -0.3361468   0.4745285  -0.2919902
  -0.2944298   0.5578587  -0.3939745
   0.1732060   0.6325838   0.7298870
  -0.5161855  -0.1218247   0.0057037

The dominant loadings are:
First eiegen vector = -0.5161 = 1/cityMPG
Second eigen vector = 0.6325 = year
Third eigen vector = 0.72988 = year

This can be interpreted as: the fuel economy depends on the year in which the vechicle was manufactured and the city gallons/mile value of the engine.
