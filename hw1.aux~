Question 1:

(a) Standard basis vector of size 3 = 3*3 identity matrix 

octave:1> eye (3)
ans =

Diagonal Matrix

   1   0   0
   0   1   0
   0   0   1

This needs to be transformed to matrix A which = [T(e1),T(e2),T(e3)] = [a1,a2,a3]

octave:2> a1 = [3;-2;1]
a1 =

   3
  -2
   1

octave:3> a2 = [6;0;7]
a2 =

   6
   0
   7
octave:5> a3 = [5;4;-1]
a3 =

   5
   4
  -1

then T(e1) = a1
hence T(e1) = T(1,0,0) = a1
or T(e1) = T(x,y,z) = (3x,-2x,x)

T(e2) = a2
or T(e2) = T(x,y,z) = (6y,0,7y)

T(e3) = a3
or T(e3) = T(x,y,z) = (5z,4z, -z)

or A(x,y,z) = [(3x,-2x,x), (6y,0,7y), (5z,4z,-z)] assuming (x,y,z are the values of corresponding e<i> vector)


(b) Given a identity matrix of size 2
octave:6> eye (2)
ans =

Diagonal Matrix

   1   0
   0   1


[e1,e2] needs to be transformed into [4e2,-e1]

Hence A should be 
octave:8> A = [0,-1;4,0]
A =

   0  -1
   4   0

Identity matrix * Tranformation matrix = Resultant matrix A
or transformation matrix  is also = A

transformation matrix =

   0  -1
   4   0

(c) octave:11> M = [1, 0 ; 1 ,1]
M =

   1   0
   1   1

X axis is represented by the matrix C1 = [t; 0] where t is a variable definfing the value of x at that point in the x axis.

to transform X axis we need to : M * C1

   1   0  * t   = t    
   1   1    0     t

The transformation is a matrix [t;t] which is represented by the line x=y. This is because for ex :

if t=4 the point which is defined by [t;t] = [4;4]
if t=6.5 the point which is defined by [t;t] = [6.5;6.5] i.e 

y = mx + c is the eqn of any staright line. 
where m = y2-y1/x2-x1 = 2.5/2.5 = 1; hence eqn => y = x +c

substitutitng (4,6) => 4 = 4 + c or c = 0 

So the eqn of the line => y = x

Similarly the line y = 2 can be represented by the matrix c2 = [ t;2] 

to transform X axis we need to : M * C1

   1   0  * t   = t    
   1   1    2     t+2

The transformation is a matrix [t;t+2] which is represented by the line x+2=y. This is because for ex :

if t=4 the point which is defined by [t;t+2] = [4;6]
if t=6.5 the point which is defined by [t;t] = [6.5;8.5] i.e 

y = mx + c is the eqn of any staright line. 
where m = y2-y1/x2-x1 = 2/2 = 1; hence eqn => y = x +c

substitutitng (4,6) => 4 = 2 + c or c = 2 

So the eqn of the line => y = x + 2
